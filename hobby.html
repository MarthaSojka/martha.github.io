                <h3>Music: listening and playing</h3>
                
                <p>Music has been an unwavering and cherished companion throughout my life, enriching my journey with its melodic tapestry. Beyond the role of an avid listener, I have embraced the identity of an active musician. A crowning achievement in my musical odyssey is the completion of my second-degree music school education, specializing in percussion instruments. This comprehensive training delves into the intricacies of various percussion instruments, including drums, marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, and more. It has endowed me with a profound understanding of both the theoretical and practical dimensions of music.</p>
                <img src="./foto/instruments.jpg" class="hobby" alt="percussion instruments"/>
                <p>Moreover, as an additional musical endeavor, I have had the privilege of playing the piano. This instrument serves as a soothing and reflective escape, allowing me to unwind, relax, and find solace amidst its harmonious notes. Whether it's the energetic rhythms of percussion instruments or the serene melodies of the piano, my connection to music remains profound, reflecting my commitment to creativity, expression, and relaxation.</p>
                <p>My passion for music is a diverse voyage through various genres and styles, bridging the classical and contemporary realms. Music, in my view, is an art that possesses the remarkable ability to inspire, console, and unite people across diverse cultures and backgrounds. Consequently, I invest my time in music with an unwavering commitment.</p>
               
                <p>Within my musical journey, I proudly achieved a musical high school diploma. This accomplishment is a testament not only to my dedication to music but also to my proficiency in using it as a vehicle for self-expression. Whether I'm lost in the rhythmic beats of the drum set, exploring the intricate tonalities of the marimba, unraveling the subtleties of the vibraphone, or crafting harmonious melodies on the xylophone, music is an integral part of my existence — a source of boundless joy and creative expression.</p>

                <h3>Sport: aikido, swimming</h3>
                <p>Sports have always played a profound role in shaping my character, instilling me with energy, discipline, and a constant drive for personal growth. Among the various athletic pursuits, Aikido stands out as a martial art that has left a deep and lasting impression on my life. It's not merely a means of combat but a profound philosophy centered around harmonious and graceful movements. In my relentless pursuit of mastery, I am currently preparing for my 5th kyu examination in Aikido—a testament to my unwavering dedication and ongoing commitment to this art form.</p>
                <img src="./foto/aikido1.jpg" class="hobby aikido" alt="logo aikido Hanami Dojo" />
                <p>Aikido, often described as "the art of peace," teaches the practitioner to channel and redirect the opponent's force, emphasizing the avoidance of confrontation and violence. Through Aikido, I've not only developed my physical strength but also cultivated a profound sense of balance and mindfulness, which I carry into every facet of my life. This ancient discipline has shaped my character, instilling me with valuable lessons about the power of blending with life's challenges rather than clashing with them.</p>
                <p>In addition to Aikido, I find solace and joy in the serene world of swimming. The tranquil embrace of the water and the rhythmic strokes create a meditative experience, allowing me to both unwind and maintain my physical fitness. The combination of Aikido's disciplined artistry and swimming's therapeutic rhythm provides me with a delicate equilibrium — a fusion of the powerful and the tranquil.</p>
                <p>The profound philosophies of Aikido and the calming waters of swimming serve as constant reminders of the values I strive to integrate into both my personal and professional life: perseverance, technical precision, and unwavering focus. These principles guide me in navigating the complexities of challenges, both in and out of the dojo and swimming pool.</p>
